Get more done by leveraging your team
::

::SubTitle
We should rely on the skills of other to produce more.
::

::Paragraph
On my very first day as a Software Engineer, contracted by Vanguard in SE PA, I was standing in the hall waiting more a meeting room to open up.
I didn't know anyone since this was my first day, I was standing by myself leaning up against the wall, holding my notebook, across from the meeting room.
::

::Paragraph
My new and very talented engineering manager approached me and started a conversation with some small talk, welcoming me to the team.
He ended the conversation by providing me with some valuable words of advice for starting my new career that I have never forgotten.
He said, "If you want to get a lot done, leverage your team."
::

::Paragraph
I think back to this moment often as this talented senior engineering manager chose these words, this advice, to start my career.
It must have held enough significance in his experience to offer this advice first.  So, why was this so important?

First, what does "Leveraging your team" mean?
::

::Paragraph
"Leveraging your team" as a software engineer means effectively utilizing the skills, expertise, and diverse perspectives of your team members to accomplish project goals.
It involves assigning tasks based on individual strengths, fostering collaboration for problem-solving, and promoting knowledge sharing to enhance overall productivity and the quality of the software being developed.
It also entails recognizing and appreciating each team member's contributions, ensuring effective communication channels, and empowering team members to take ownership of their work.
::

::Paragraph
In Front End Development terms, it means knowing and learning your team's strengths and weaknesses and utilizing their talents.
Perhaps you have a developer on the team who is very strong in CSS.
When a project comes up with a tight deadline, allocate tasks by these strengths to get those task done more quickly.
::

::Paragraph
It doesn't mean that those weaknesses should be ignored or shouldn't be addressed.
With that knowledge of your team's weaknesses, actions should be taken to build the skill set of your developers.
When time is available, be available to answer questions to address these weaknesses and to build up your coworkers.
In fact, knowledge sharing occurs when those who are good at something are given this opportunity to do what they are good at.
You can use that code as examples of what went well, perhaps in a retrospective.

You're never alone
::

::Paragraph
I see Software Engineering as the ultimate team "sport".
It takes the talent of many individuals across many disciplines to produce applications of value.
When you're part of a team, you're never alone (at least this is true in positive company cultures).
If you're a junior, you need help in gaining experience and knowledge through senior developers to grow.
If you're a senior, you need help in completing tasks by leveraging junior developers.
In all cases, we rely on others.

::Paragraph
Ultimately, leveraging your team as a software engineer leads to more efficient development processes, better software outcomes, and a stronger, more cohesive team.
