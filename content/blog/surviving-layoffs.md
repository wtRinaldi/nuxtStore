Tips for surviving a layoff
::

::Paragraph
Amidst the current wave of layoffs, it's evident that the software development job market is facing significant challenges.
If you find yourself worrying about potential layoffs or have recently been laid off, it's crucial to take proactive steps to navigate this uncertain terrain.
First, I want to share my own experience.

My layoff
::

::Paragraph
I experienced my first layoff in February 2024, after seven years in the software industry and even going back through a prior career spanning back to 2000.
It's fair to say I've been fortunate until now.
::

::Paragraph
As a father of four young children and the sole provider for my family, the stakes are high. My wife and I homeschool our children, making my income essential.
Despite our efforts to keep expenses in check, our monthly rent, including utilities, sits at $3000, and our food bill naturally reflects the needs of a household of six.
Additionally, our youngest son has a heart condition that necessitates ongoing medical monitoring. Managing his healthcare adds to our expenses and concerns during this challenging time.

The job market
::

::Paragraph
The issue, as many recently laid-off individuals can attest, is that the job market is severely strained.
I understand that leaders often tout the job market as being the best it's ever been, but from my perspective, particularly within the software industry, I don't see evidence to support this claim.
It's not uncommon to come across job listings with over 500 applicants on platforms like LinkedIn alone.
That figure doesn't even account for the numerous other job sites where the position might be posted.
::

::Paragraph
I've personally encountered job listings with an astonishing 12,500 applicants!
It begs the question: who continues to apply after the first thousand?"
::

::Paragraph
This, of course, is disheartening when you are looking to support yourself and potentially others with your income.
I wanted to share some tips for making it through or surviving this downturn.

Hold these traits dear to you
::

::Paragraph
**Gratitude**

Amidst the stress of uncertain times, it's vital to pause and reflect on our blessings.
We all have aspects of our lives that bring us joy; it's about taking the time to appreciate them.
For me, that joy comes from spending quality time with my children.
::

::Paragraph
In moments spent with them, I'm reminded of the genuine priorities in life, which helps lessen the impact of a job loss.
It's these moments of gratitude that provide solace and perspective during challenging times.
::

::Paragraph
**Humility**

Even with a healthy perspective on your job loss, it is important to reach out to others for help; to discuss your situation; for support.
There are also a lot of community resources that you can get help in surviving your layoff.

Emergency Funds
::

::Paragraph
If you're currently employed but worried about the possibility of a layoff, prioritizing savings for an emergency fund is crucial.
Each situation varies, but if your household relies on a single income, building a substantial emergency fund becomes imperative.
For those with dual incomes, the size of the emergency fund might differ.
::

::Paragraph
Rather than splurging on luxuries like new cars, dining out, or extravagant vacations, channel resources into building an emergency fund that offers peace of mind during uncertain times.
::

::Paragraph
If you've recently experienced a layoff and find yourself without an adequate emergency fund, or if your existing fund falls short, you may need to explore additional sources of income.
In such circumstances, it's essential to remain humble and seek assistance from community resources.
Doing so can provide a lifeline, offering valuable support and buying you some extra time as you navigate the job market

Conclusion
::

::Paragraph
I know this doesn't fix the situation that we are in but perhaps it lets others know that you're not alone and provides a few words of hope.
::

::Paragraph
**Don't give up!**
Stay positive, humble, and grateful!  Godspeed in your employment journeys fellow devs!
